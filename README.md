# TwitterWeatherData


This project aims to extract weather data from the web using Python and display it in a concise format on Twitter.

In the future, improvements that can be made include:
  * Displaying the weather data for the entire week
  * Providing heat index (feels like temperature)
  * Adding pictures for better UI
