# TwitterWeatherData


This project aims to extract weather data from the web using Python and display it in a concise format on Twitter. Utilizing the BeautifulSoup Python package alongside the requests module, I scraped weather data online and used the appropiate HTML tags I found in the page source to get the details. I then used the Tweepy Python package to access the Twitter API to simplify the tweeting process. 

In the future, improvements that can be made include:
  * Displaying the weather data for the entire week
  * Providing heat index (feels like temperature)
  * Adding pictures for better UI
